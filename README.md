# Caesar Cipher HTTP Server

This is a simple HTTP server built using Python that allows users to encrypt or decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher method. The server processes both GET and POST requests, providing an interactive web interface where users can input their message, the shift value, and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt.

## Features

- **Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypt or decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher.
- **Web Interface**: Users can interact with the Caesar Cipher through a simple HTML form served by the HTTP server.
- **Support for Uppercase and Lowercase Letters**: The Caesar Cipher operation works on both uppercase and lowercase letters, while non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
